            A talented tabby hailing from Missouri vaulted over a jump rope nine times in one minute to break the record for most skips by a cat in one minute.

Owner Trisha Seifried said she and 13-year-old Kit Kat have been practicing jump rope routines since the cat was only 6 months old, and the skill has led to appearances on Jimmy Kimmel Live! and a social media ad campaign for Friskie
